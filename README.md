Stripeflare is middleware that adds Stripe Payments to a Cloudflare Worker and have users keep track of a balance in your own database, without requiring third-party authentication (Just Stripe Payment)! Let me know your thoughts in [this thread](https://x.com/janwilmake/status/1924404433317675347) and check [the demo](https://x.com/janwilmake/status/1924766605143142683)

# Automatic Installation.

```sh
npx create-stripeflare
```

See [create-stripeflare](https://github.com/janwilmake/create-stripeflare) for more detailed instructions.

# Manual Installation

First install the package (which also installs [DORM](https://github.com/janwilmake/dorm))

```sh
npm i stripeflare
```

The easiest way to install stripeflare **for existing projects**, is to use `withStripeflare` which wraps your entire `ExportedHandler`:

## `main.ts`

```ts
import { withStripeflare, StripeUser, DORM } from "stripeflare";
export { DORM };

type Env = {};

export default {
  // StripeUser can be extended
  fetch: withStripeflare<Env, StripeUser>(
    async (request, env, ctx) => {
      // ctx.user, ctx.client are now available
      const { user, registered } = ctx;

      if (request.url.endsWith("/charge")) {
        if (user.balance < 1) {
          return new Response("Payment Required", { status: 402 });
        }
        return new Response(JSON.stringify(result), {
          headers: {
            // Charges one cent
            "X-Price": "1",
          },
        });
      }

      return new Response(`Hello ${user.name || "Anonymous"}`);
    },
    {
      // customMigrations: optional way to overwrite default user table with an extension to your database
      // version: "1" // resets data
    }
  ),
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

`wrangler.json|toml`

The following adds DORM durable object to your Cloudflare Bindings, which stripeflare uses to allow for lightning-fast user balance charges.

```json
{
  "name": "stripeflare-example",
  "compatibility_date": "2025-06-06",
  "main": "main.ts",
  "durable_objects": {
    "bindings": [{ "name": "DORM_NAMESPACE", "class_name": "DORM" }]
  },
  "migrations": [{ "tag": "v1", "new_sqlite_classes": ["DORM"] }]
}
```

For TOML:

```toml
name = "stripeflare-example"
main = "main.ts"
compatibility_date = "2025-06-06"

[[durable_objects.bindings]]
name = "DORM_NAMESPACE"
class_name = "DORM"

[[migrations]]
tag = "v1"
new_sqlite_classes = ["DORM"]
```

`.dev.vars`

```env
# Create a Stripe account, navigate to https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys and collect `STRIPE_SECRET` and `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
STRIPE_SECRET=
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
# Create a webhook at https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks/create. Endpoint URL: https://yourdomain.com/stripe-webhook and sollect `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET`
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET=
# Create a payment link at https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links and set this as `STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK`
STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK=
# Put a 32 character+ secret here to sign your secrets
DB_SECRET=
```

## Usage

`withStripeflare` passes the follwoing to your `fetch` handler:

- `ctx.charge(amount, allowNegativeBalance)` charges the user
- `ctx.user` has a user object with or without details
- `ctx.client` contains your db client

In other handlers (schedules, queue, etc) you can use the `chargeUser` utility function to easily charge a user given their access_token:

```ts
const chargeUser = async (
  env: Env,
  ctx: ExecutionContext,
  user_access_token: string,
  migrations: any | undefined,
  version: string | undefined,
  amountCent: number,
  allowNegativeBalance: boolean
) => Promise<{ charged: boolean; message: string }>;
```

In your static files you can also access these:

- `GET /me` returns `{paymentLink,client_reference_id, balance, name, email, card_fingerprint, verified_email }` which can be useful to show these details fast. Requires cookie!
- `POST /rotate-token` (to rotate the token, instable, may be removed in future version)
- `/db/*` To access admin DB panel -see [outerbase](#outerbase)

Besides that, stripeflare standardises and uses the following response headers:

- You can pass `X-Price` to charge users automatically (amount in cents)
- Stripeflare passes `X-PaymentLink` with the paymentlink for the user
- Stripeflare passes `X-Balance` with the balance of the current user in cents

# About

## Features

- **Performant**: Creates a DB for each user while also mirroring it into an aggregate db (powered by [Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/) and [DORM](https://getdorm.com)), resulting in lightning-fast worker requests with user-balance.
- **Flexible**: Leverages [`?client_reference_id`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-client_reference_id) ensure connection to the user session whilst using any [Stripe Payment Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links).
- **Extensible**: Hooks into your own DO-based database so you can extend it however you like.
- **Login by Payment**: Users can access their previous balance from any device as long as they use the same Stripe Payment method (only supports payment methods `card` and `link`, see [ADR](ADR.md))

## Outerbase

Stripeflare exposes an admin panel to easily manage the users.

Login into the aggregate DB:

- URL: https://your-worker.domain.com/db/admin-readonly
- Username: admin-readonly
- Password: [your DB_SECRET environment variable]

Individual User Access:

- URL: https://your-worker.domain.com/db/[client_reference_id]
- Username: user-[client_reference_id]
- Password: the users [access_token]

## When can you use this?

1. You want to use Cloudflare Workers for your app, with [DORM](https://github.com/janwilmake/dorm) as your database with segmentation on the user-level with one aggregate-db
2. You are VERY concerned with the performance of charging users. A user should be able to be charged within ¬±20ms.
3. You can use the source code as a starting point, giving you a virtual wallet system for your DORM-database. You don't need to use it as a dependency if you need additional logic and enhanced security.

## Good to know

- When you care a lot about multiple layers of security, don't use this. Currently, access_tokens are stored in the database as-is without encryption, which could expose them if other layers of security are compromised.
- When you want more production-ready things, don't use this. May still get breaking changes. This is still a research-project with limitations. See [ADR](ADR.md) for details.
- We have some well-thoguht-out logic in the stripe webhook, allowing login-by-payment; read more here: https://www.letmeprompt.com/httpsrawgithubus-20o3gj0
- It is a massive improvement upon [Cloudflare Sponsorware](https://github.com/janwilmake/cloudflare-sponsorware) which I made before as it dramatically reduces complexity while improving upon UX and DX.

# Advanced Usage

## Extending the Schema with Custom Migrations

Stripeflare uses [DORM](https://github.com/janwilmake/dorm) for database management and supports custom migrations to extend the user schema beyond the default fields. The `users` table must contain these **required columns** (all should be indexed for performance). You can extend the schema by replacing the DORM durable object with one that include additional columns. This also allows doing anything else in your user objects. See [This Example](template-extended.ts)
